# COSC-4327-Hmwk-Candy-Bowl
Java synchronized thread example.

Problem:

A group of N faculty members are sitting around a bowl of candy, which holds M pieces of candy.  Each of the N faculty members spends his life thinking and eating candy.  They must have a piece of candy to think.  One Teaching Assistant spends his life sleeping except that when the bowl is empty he is woken up and fills the candy bowl.  Only one faculty member can access the bowl at a time.

Write a solution to the above problem.  You can use any language and can use either a Semaphore approach or a Monitor (Java synchronized class).

Turn in working source code to Blackboard.

A ‘Professional Grade’ solution (i.e. A option) would have features such as a GUI which would allow for a varying number of faculty, speed up, slow down, etc.

Example program contains JFrame GUI.
